* When creating CSS selectors, ensure they are unique and specific enough to select only one element from the page snapshot, even if there are multiple elements of the same type (like multiple h1 elements).
* Avoid using generic tags like 'h1' alone. Instead, combine them with expected text, other attributes or structural relationships to form a unique selector.
* Avoid using CSS selectors that appears to be randomly generated.
* You should try not to derive data directly from the page if you are able to do so by using one of the provided functions, e.g. locator_evaluate.
